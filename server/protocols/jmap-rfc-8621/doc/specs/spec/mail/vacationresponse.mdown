# Vacation Response

> :information_source:
> Implemented

A vacation response sends an automatic reply when a message is delivered to the mail store, informing the original sender that their message may not be read for some time.

Automated message sending can produce undesirable behaviour. To avoid this, implementors MUST follow the recommendations set forth in [@!RFC3834].

The **VacationResponse** object represents the state of vacation-response-related settings for an account. It has the following properties:

- **id**: `Id` (immutable; server-set)
  The id of the object. There is only ever one VacationResponse object, and its id is `"singleton"`.
- **isEnabled**: `Boolean`
  Should a vacation response be sent if a message arrives between the *fromDate* and *toDate*?
- **fromDate**: `UTCDate|null`
  If *isEnabled* is `true`, messages that arrive on or after this date-time (but before the *toDate* if defined) should receive the user's vacation response. If `null`, the vacation response is effective immediately.
- **toDate**: `UTCDate|null`
  If *isEnabled* is `true`, messages that arrive before this date-time (but on or after the *fromDate* if defined) should receive the user's vacation response. If `null`, the vacation response is effective indefinitely.
- **subject**: `String|null`
  The subject that will be used by the message sent in response to messages when the vacation response is enabled. If `null`, an appropriate subject SHOULD be set by the server.
- **textBody**: `String|null`
  The plaintext body to send in response to messages when the vacation response is enabled. If this is `null`, the server SHOULD generate a plaintext body part from the *htmlBody* when sending vacation responses but MAY choose to send the response as HTML only. If both *textBody* and *htmlBody* are `null`, an appropriate default body SHOULD be generated for responses by the server.
- **htmlBody**: `String|null`
  The HTML body to send in response to messages when the vacation response is enabled. If this is `null`, the server MAY choose to generate an HTML body part from the *textBody* when sending vacation responses or MAY choose to send the response as plaintext only.

The following JMAP methods are supported.

## VacationResponse/get

This is a standard "/get" method as described in [@!RFC8620], Section 5.1.

There MUST only be exactly one VacationResponse object in an account. It MUST have the id "singleton".

## VacationResponse/set

This is a standard "/set" method as described in [@!RFC8620], Section 5.3.

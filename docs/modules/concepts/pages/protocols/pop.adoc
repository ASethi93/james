= Post Office Protocol (POP)
:navtitle: POP

== Overview

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol[Post Office Protocol], 
or POP, is described in the original specification
as being "a simple method for workstations to dynamically access mail from 
a xref:storage/index.adoc[mailbox server]" (though interestingly "mailbox server" 
is never actually defined in this specification nor in later specifications. ðŸ¤”)

POP was proposed as the first non-xref:protocols/smtp.adoc[SMTP] protocol aimed
at users for the purpose of retrieving emails stored remotely for local consumption.
POP was developed in pre-spam days, so was inherently a non-secure protocol.
It has been updated several times to address several issues, including lack of
security, so that POP3 is now the current specification.

As the name suggests, the protocol is modeled after a post office. The analogy being:

 * The various SMTP servers along the transmission chain are like post offices
 * The user's mail server is the local post office that will dispatch the mail to the recipient
 * The postman is, ummm, well no analogy is perfect ðŸ˜¬
 * The mail gets dropped into the user's mailbox (though just to make the analogy even 
    muddier there is an option to leave a copy on the server)

Analogies aside, the protocol worked quite well for most users, and is still widely
in use today.

POP requires essentially two pieces, the POP Client and the POP Server. How the
message gets initially delivered to the POP Server and how a message is managed
once delivered to the POP Client is out of scope of the POP protocol.


== Specifications

=== POP

POP has been around since the early days of email. The original specification
<<RFC918>> was published in 1984. 


==== RFC918

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc918[RFC918] ("Post Office Protocol") was the original
specification published in 1984. The RFC "suggests a simple method for workstations 
to dynamically access mail from a mailbox server."
Like xref:protocols/smtp.adoc[SMTP] that came before it, POP is a session-based
protocol with a handful of defined commands.
This RFC was obsoleted shortly after its publication by <<RFC937>>.




=== POP2

==== RFC937

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc937[RFC937] ("Post Office Protocol - Version 2") or more
commonly "POP2" was a revision of the original <<RFC918>> specification. POP2 specifies
connection over port 109, and clarifies that "it is important for the mailbox to be on 
an 'always up' machine and that a workstation may be frequently powered down, or
otherwise unavailable as an SMTP server." In other words, as the Internet continued to
evolve, this specification was an attempt to evolve with it.

POP2 was replaced by POP3, which was first published as <<RFC1081>>.



=== POP3

==== RFC1081

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1081[RFC1081] ("Post Office Protocol - Version 3")
was the first published version of POP3,
made available in 1988. It adds additional functionality for managing mail, and
perhaps most importantly, it adds an authentication mechanism. This version was
obsoleted by <<RFC1225>>.


==== RFC1225

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1225[RFC1225] ("Post Office Protocol - Version 3")
obsoleted <<RFC1081>>. It is described as being a "republication" of <<RFC1081>>,
and does not appear to add anything significant. It was obsoleted by
<<RFC1460>>.


==== RFC1460

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1460[RFC1460] ("Post Office Protocol - Version 3")
provided some relatively minor updates to <<RFC1225>>, and was itself obsoleted
about one year later by <<RFC1725>>.


==== RFC1725

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1725[RFC1725] ("Post Office Protocol - Version 3")
was again a relatively minor update of <<RFC1460>>, and was itself obsoleted
about two years later by <<RFC1939>>.


==== RFC1939

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1939[RFC1939] ("Post Office Protocol - Version 3")
is the most recent specification of POP3, and is the version in use today. 

This specification seems to imply that POP3 is used for "simple" transactions,
and for more "advanced" transactions xref:protocols/imap.adoc[IMAP] is available.



=== POP4

Although there was development on the http://www.pop4.org/[POP4] specification,
development appears to have stalled for several years, making POP3 the
still-current protocol.



== Related Concepts

POP relates to...

 * *xref:protocols/imap.adoc[IMAP]* as a "competing" protocol
 * *xref:glossary.adoc#email_client[Email clients]*, in that the client acts as a POP Client
 * *xref:storage/index.adoc[Storage]* in that messages are stored temporarily on
   a ????  while awaiting transfer to the client
 * *xref:protocols/smtp.adoc[SMTP]*, in that messages will normally be
   delivered to the IMAP Server via SMTP.

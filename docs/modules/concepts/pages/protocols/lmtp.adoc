= Local Mail Transfer Protocol (LMTP)
:navtitle: LMTP

== Overview

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Mail_Transfer_Protocol[Local Mail Transfer Protocol] ("LMTP")
is

From <<RFC2033>>:

   Although LMTP is an alternative protocol to ESMTP, it uses (with a
   few changes) the syntax and semantics of ESMTP.  This design permits
   LMTP to utilize the extensions defined for ESMTP.  LMTP should be
   used only by specific prior arrangement and configuration, and it
   MUST NOT be used on TCP port 25.

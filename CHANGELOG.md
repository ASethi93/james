## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Partial Support for JMAP RFC-8621: The current implementation status allow reading mailboxes, emails, vacation responses
- JAMES-3117 Add PeriodicalHealthChecks for periodical calling all health checks
- JAMES-3143 WebAdmin endpoint to solve Cassandra message inconsistencies
- JAMES-3138 Webadmin endpoint to recompute users current quotas on top of Guice products
- JAMES-3296 Webadmin endpoint to rebuild RabbitMQMailQueue in the Distributed Server
- JAMES-3266 Offer an option to disable ElasticSearch in Distributed James product
- JAMES-3202 Reindex only outdated documents with the Mode option set to CORRECT in reindexing tasks
- JAMES-3405 Expose metrics of Guice servers over HTTP - enables easy Prometheus metrics collection
- JAMES-3407 Distributed server: Read-repairs for the mailbox entity
- JAMES-3428 Distributed server: Read-repairs for the mailbox counters entity

### Changed
- Switch to Java 11 for build and run
- JAMES-2760 mailqueue.size.metricsEnabled should be false by default
- JAMES-3252 DomainList autoDetection should be turned off by default. Operators relying on implicit values for enabling DomainList autoDetection now needs to explicitly configure it.
- JAMES-3295 Multiple IMAP performance enhancements for the Distributed Server. Some enhancement might transfer to other servers as well.
- JAMES-3184 Throttling mechanism allow an admin to specify the throughput desired for a given WebAdmin task
- JAMES-3224 Configuration for Cassandra ConsistencyLevel.{QUORUM, SERIAL} (for multi-dc configuration)
- JAMES-3263 Optimize RecipientRewriteTable::getMappingsForType
- JAMES-3176 Rewritte MDN parsing with Parboiled scala (avoid asm library dependency clash within the Distributed Server)
- JAMES-3194 Rely on DTOConverter in TaskRoute
- JAMES-3430 Restructure message properties storage within Cassandra Mailbox. See upgrade instructions.
- JAMES-3435 Use EventSourcing to manage ACL - avoid SERIAL reads for ACL thus unlocking a performance enhancement for the Distributed James server. Read upgrade instructions.

### Deprecated
- HybridBlobStore. This will be removed after 3.6.0 release. Introduced to fasten small blob access, its usage could be
compared to a cache, but with a sub-optimal implementation (no eviction, default replication factor, no  circuit breaking).
Use BlobStore cache instead.

### Fixed
- JAMES-3305 Avoid crashes upon deserialization issues when consuming RabbitMQ messages, leverage dead-letter feature
- JAMES-3212 JMAP Handle subcrible/unsubcrible child's folder when update mailbox
- JAMES-3416 Fix ElasticSearch email address search
- JAMES-1677 Upgrade default hasing algorithm to SHA-512

### Removed
 - HybridBlobStore. This will be removed after 3.6.0 release. Introduced to fasten small blob access, its usage could be
 compared to a cache, but with a sub-optimal implementation (no eviction, default replication factor, no  circuit breaking).
 Use BlobStore cache instead.

## [3.5.0] - 2020-04-06

### Added
- JAMES-2813 task management for Distributed James product. This enables several James servers to share a consistent view
of tasks being currently executed.
- JAMES-2563 Health check for ElasticSearch
- JAMES-2904 Authentication and SSL support for Cassandra backend
- JAMES-2904 Authentication and SSL support for ElasticSearch backend
- JAMES-3066 Add support alias when sending emails, with a "allowed From headers" webadmin endpoint

- JAMES-3058 WebAdmin offline task to correct mailbox inconsistencies on top of Cassandra products
- JAMES-3105 WebAdmin offline task to recompute mailbox counters on top of Cassandra products
- JAMES-3072 WebAdmin endpoint to export mailbox backup

### Changed
  - Use of routing keys to collocate documents per mailbox
  - Under some configuration, html was not extracted before document indexing
  - Removed unnecessary fields from mailbox mapping
  - Disable dynamic mapping thanks to a change of the header structure
- Multiple changes have been made to enhance Distributed James indexing performance:
  - JAMES-2917 Use of routing keys to collocate documents per mailbox
  - JAMES-2910 Under some configuration, html was not extracted before document indexing
  - JAMES-2079 Removed unnecessary fields from mailbox mapping
  - JAMES-2078 Disable dynamic mapping thanks to a change of the header structure
  - Read related [upgrade instructions](upgrade-instructions.md)
- JAMES-2855 Multiple library/plugin/docker images/build tool upgrades
- JAMES-2981 By default the cassandra keyspace creation by James is now disabled by default. This allow to have credentials limited to a keyspace. It can be enabled by setting cassandra.keyspace.create=true in the cassandra.properties file.
- Usernames are assumed to be always lower cased. Many users recently complained about mails non received when sending to upper cased local recipients. We decided to simplify the handling of case for local recipients and users by always storing them lower cased.
- JAMES-2576 Unhealthy health checks now return HTTP 503 instead of 500, degraded now returns 200 instead of 500. See JAMES-2576.
- JAMES-2992 In order to fasten JMAP-draft message retrieval upon calls on properties expected to be fast to fetch, we now compute the preview and hasAttachment properties asynchronously and persist them in Cassandra to improve performance. See JAMES-2919.
- JAMES-2950 It is now forbidden to create new Usernames with the following set of characters in its local part : `"(),:; <>@\[]`, as we prefer it to stay simple to handle. However, the read of Usernames already existing with some of those characters is still allowed, to not introduce any breaking change. See JAMES-2950.
- JAMES-3040 Linshare blob export configuration and mechanism change.
- JAMES-3112 Differentiation between domain alias and domain mapping. Read upgrade instructions.
- JAMES-3122 Log4J2 adoption for Spring product. Log file configuration needs to be updated. See upgrade instructions.

### Fixed

- JAMES-2972 Incorrect attribute name in the mailet configuration thanks to jtconsol
- JAMES-2632 JMAP Draft GetMailboxes performance enhancements when retrieving all mailboxes of a user
- JAMES-2964 Forbid to create User quota/ Domain quota/ Global quota using negative number
- JAMES-3074 Fixing UidValidity generation, sanitizing of invalid values upon reads. Read upgrade instructions.

### Removed
- Classes marked as deprecated whose removal was planned after 3.4.0 release (See JAMES-2703). This includes:
  - SieveDefaultRepository. Please use SieveFileRepository instead.
  - JDBCRecipientRewriteTable, XMLRecipientRewriteTable, UsersRepositoryAliasingForwarding, JDBCAlias mailets. Please use RecipientRewriteTable mailet instead.
  - JDBCRecipientRewriteTable implementation. Please use JPARecipientRewriteTable instead.
  - JamesUsersJdbcRepository, DefaultUsersJdbcRepository. Please use JpaUsersRepository instead.
  - MailboxQuotaFixed matcher. Please use IsOverQuota instead.
- UsersFileRepository, which was marked as deprecated for years
  - We accordingly removed deprecated methods within UsersRepositoryManagementMBean exposed over JMX (unsetAlias, getAlias, unsetForwardAddress, getForwardAddress). RecipientRewriteTables should be used instead.
- JAMES-3016 RemoteDelivery now doesn't enable `allow8bitmime` property by default. 
This parameter could cause body content alteration leading to DKIM invalid DKIM signatures to be positioned. 
Thanks to Sergey B. for the report. 
More details about the property is at [java mail doc](https://javaee.github.io/javamail/docs/api/com/sun/mail/smtp/package-summary.html)
 - JAMES-3122 LogEnabled API in Spring product had been removed for Log4J2 adoption for Java 9+ runtime compatibility.
 - JAMES-3122 LogEnabled API in Spring product had been removed for Log4J2 adoption for Java 9+ runtime compatibility. 
 - HybridBlobStore. This will be removed after 3.6.0 release. Introduced to fasten small blob access, its usage could be
 compared to a cache, but with a sub-optimal implementation (no eviction, default replication factor, no  circuit breaking).
 Use BlobStore cache instead.
 - JAMES-3028 OpenStack's Swift support. It was very complex, slow and even slowed down AWS S3 implementation.
 
### Third party softwares
 - The distributed James server product (relying on Guice, Cassandra, ElasticSearch, RabbitMQ and optionally Swift) now needs at least RabbitMQ 3.8.1.

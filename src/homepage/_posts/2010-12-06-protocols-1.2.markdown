The Java Apache Mail Enterprise Server (a.k.a. Apache James) Project is happy to announce
the release of version 3.0-M2 (Milestone 2) of the Apache James server.

M2 is not only a fast corrective release on M1 (issues related to JMX
security configuration on Windows platforms,...), but also contains an important number
of enhancement and JIRA fixes.

For example, memory usage has been reduced thanks to optimizations on
the ActiveMQ component usage (responsible for the mail spooling).

We thank all Users for their feedback and tests and we encourage
anyone to discover this Milestone 2 release.

The James commiters have voted to promote the Mailet API to its own James sub-project.

This move will provide a clearer division between development of the API and development of James server, and we hope
this will encourage more participation from external projects.

The effort will start small, by releasing the current version, and move on to look at the enhancements we've been
discussing over on [the mailet api list][list] where we will extend a warm welcome to anyone
who has something to contribute.

Eventually we hope to extend the scope of the sub-project to include things like a Reference Implementation independent
of James Server and suitable for embedding, an SDK, and possibly a TCK.

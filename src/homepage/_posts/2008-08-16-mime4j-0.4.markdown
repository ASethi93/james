We are proud to announce the [availability][availability] of APACHE Mime4j-0.4. This release brings a number of
significant improvements in terms of supported capabilities, flexibility and performance:

  - Revised and improved public API with support for pull parsing
  - Support for parsing of 'headless' messages transmitted using non SMTP transports such as HTTP
  - Reduced external dependencies. Mime4j is no longer directly dependent on log4j and commons-io
  - Improved parsing performance (up to 10x for large messages)
  - More comprehensive header parsing including support for RFC1864, RFC2045, RFC2183, RFC2557 and RFC3066
  - Revised packaging and exception hierarchy. MimeException now extends IOException

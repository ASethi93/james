The Apache James Project is happy to announce
the release of version 0.2 of the Apache James jDKIM library.

jDKIM is a DKIM implementation library written in Java. It provides
both verification and signing and also provides Mailets for the
Apache JAMES project.

This is the first official release of the library, but the code has
been in production almost unchanged since two years.

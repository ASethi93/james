The James Team are delighted to announce that we're proposing two project ideas for
[Google Summer of Code (GSOC) 2008][gsoc]. The project Ideas are set out on the Apache GSOC
wiki [here]: http://wiki.apache.org/general/SummerOfCode2008#james .

In brief they are:

 - Develop a VERP Mailet to allow James to write VERP modified return addresses on outbound messages, and an inbound mailet/matcher
 to identify VERP bounces and invoke configurable "do something" code.
 - James' provided mailing list manager is fine for small closed groups, but lacks the functionality of a more robust MLM,
 the project is to add some all or more of the following features subscriber and message moderation, double opt-in and bounce handling.
